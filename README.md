# Gesture-controlled-Gaming
Thanks Yash Kumar for helping me get this project done step by step, it is not a very uncommon project but learning it was fun. 
Run the tracker3 python file,it will take a snapshot in 3 seconds from th opening of the camera,select left hand ,press enter ,do the same for right hand. You'll be live after that. Incase you face any error while running the file please do revert back.
Now simply place your hand in front of camera now remember your left hand if forward and backward or you can say its for accelerate and brake and right hand is for steering (left and right)
