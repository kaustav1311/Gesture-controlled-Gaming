Thanks Yash Kumar for helping me get this project done step by step, it is not a very uncommon project but learning it was fun. 
Run the tracker3 python file,it will take a snapshot in 3 seconds from th opening of the camera,select left hand ,press enter ,do the same for right hand. You'll be live after that. Incase you face any error while running the file please do revert back.
